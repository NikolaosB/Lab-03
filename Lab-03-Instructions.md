# IT Infrastructure Lab 3 Instructions #
**Overview** 

In this lab, you will get a very simple introduction to the concept of "infrastructure as code" using shell scripting on your virtual machine in conjunction with Git and Github

**Prerequisites**

Lab 1: You must have configured ssh and run the Linux tutorial (or be comfortable otherwise with Linux command-line tools). 

Lab 2: You must have successfully created your own virtual machine (VM) using Vagrant. 


## Part 1: Command line operations ##

You will do the exercises in this part on your new Vagrant VM. 

Using the skills you learned in the previous lab,  perform the following steps:

**Configure a directory structure**
   
* Directory A should contain directories B, C and D

* Directory C should contain directories E and F

* Directory D should contain directories G, H and I

* Directory H should contain directories J and K


Every directory should have a file in it, with the letter of the directory doubled in lower case. E.g., directory A should have aa, F would have ff, etc. 

**Install and use tree**

Install tree 

    vagrant@precise64~: sudo apt-get install tree

Use it to inspect your directory structure. It should look like:

````
vagrant@precise64:~$ tree

|-- A
|   |-- aa
|   |-- B
|   |   `-- bb
|   |-- C
|   |   `-- cc
|   `-- D
|       `-- dd
|-- C
|   |-- cc
|   |-- E
|   |   `-- ee
|   `-- F
|       `-- ff
|-- D
|   |-- dd
|   |-- G
|   |   `-- gg
|   |-- H
|   |   |-- hh
|   |   |-- J
|   |   |   `-- jj
|   |   `-- K
|   |       `-- kk
|   `-- I
|       `-- ii
````

Now, output the tree to a file. How? 

    vagrant@precise64:~$tree > tree.txt
    
Review the text file: 

    vagrant@precise64:~$cat tree.txt

Why did I make the directory structure so detailed? This is typical of setting up infrastructure as code - you need to be able to maintain focus and successfully set up instructions that are both complicated and yet repetitive. 

Exit and destroy your VM. 

````
vagrant@precise64:~$exit
teststud@seis660:~/vagrant$ vagrant destroy -f
==> default: Forcing shutdown of VM...
==> default: Destroying VM and associated drives...
````

## Part 2: Working with git

You will do the exercises in part 2 on the main server, not your VM.

**Set up Github.com & fork this lab**

Go to http://github.com and set up a user account. 

Skim https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ (it's OK if you don't understand it all immediately - just keep following the steps here)

Go to https://github.com/StThomas-SEIS660/Lab-03 and fork the repo. Press the Fork button at top right:

![fork](resources/fork.jpg)

Now, go to your home account on Github and find the URL for the forked repository. 

Important: you should NOT be copying this:

    https://github.com/StThomas-SEIS660/Lab-03

Instead, it should look like this:

    https://github.com/your_Github_name/Lab-03

Clone the Github repository you forked as Lab-03 to your home directory /home/student/YourID/. Go into it and verify the contents look as below. Notice the username YourID; **this must be replaced with your Github user name**. 

````
teststud@seis660:~$ git clone https://github.com/CharlesTBetz/Lab-03.git
Cloning into 'Lab-03'...

teststud@seis660:~$ cd Lab-03/
teststud@seis660:~/Lab-03$ ls
Lab-03-Instructions.md	LICENSE  README.md  resources  starter.sh  Vagrantfile
````

**Try git out**

Be sure you are in the new Lab-03 directory that git created:

    vagrant@precise64:~$ cd ~/Lab-03/

Create a file called myStudentID-testfile, e.g. stud0001-testfile.md.

    teststud@seis660:~/Lab-03$ nano teststud-testfile.md 
    
Put some Markdown content in it, starting with  the phrase "Hello World." ([What's Markdown?](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)).

Exit nano (ctrl-X, saving as prompted).

Add your file to your git repository


    teststud@seis660:~/Lab-03$ git add teststud-testfile.md 
    teststud@seis660:~/Lab-03$ git commit -m "my first commit"
    
You will get:

````

 Committer: test <teststud@seis660.gps.stthomas.edu>
Your name and email address were configured automatically based
on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly:

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 teststud-testfile.md
````

Disregard the issue with your user name and email for now.

Now, edit the file again. 

    teststud@seis660:~/Lab-03$ nano teststud-testfile.md

Add "Hello Again" as a second line and exit nano in the usual way. 

You have now made a change, relative to what you committed. You can see that change through issuing the command 'git diff':

````
teststud@seis660:~/Lab-03$ git diff
diff --git a/teststud-testfile.md b/teststud-testfile.md

We will be covering git in more detail as we go, but this clearly shows that Hello Again has been added. 

Commit it again (you only need to add it once): 

````

Hit "q" to exit the commit review. (You can keep going back, but then you are getting into earlier commits on the cloned repository that I did while setting it up. More on that later.)

All of these changes have been locally committed to your git instance on your Vagrant virtual machine. Let's send them back up to your fork at Github. You will need to authenticate (we could set up ssh to github, but not right now):

````
teststud@seis660:~/Lab-03$ git push origin master

````

At this point you have pushed your file up to your LOCAL fork of the Lab-03 repository. I cannot see it unless I navigate to your Github site. 

Go back to your browser and issue a pull request:

![pull](resources/pull.jpg)

If your work is acceptable, I will allow it to be merged back into the main Lab-03 repository (actually the Spring 2015 branch).


There is much to learn about git and this lab is not intended to be a full tutorial, but rather means to an end, and a quick flavor of the techniques. We will cover further aspects as necessary. 

##Part 3: Automated provisioning

This section will bring together your VM work with git, as you develop a script to automate your activities and commit it to source control. 

**Vagrant up from the lab directory**
We will not vagrant up from your ~/vagrant directory. Instead, we will vagrant up from your ~/Lab-03 directory. A Vagrantfile has been placed there with the correct private key location. 

````
teststud@seis660:~$ cd Lab-03/
teststud@seis660:~/Lab-03$ vagrant up
Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> default: Importing base box 'precise64'...
==> default: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...
[ ... a whole lot of stuff ... ]
stdin: is not a tty
==> default: Checking for guest additions in VM...
==> default: Mounting shared folders...
    default: /vagrant => /home/student/teststud/Lab-03
````

**Script your work**

Go into your VM:

````
teststud@seis660:~/Lab-03$ vagrant ssh
Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-23-generic x86_64)

 * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com/
New release '14.04.1 LTS' available.
Run 'do-release-upgrade' to upgrade to it.

Welcome to your Vagrant-built virtual machine.
Last login: Fri Sep 14 06:23:18 2012 from 10.0.2.2
vagrant@precise64:~$ 
````

Go to the /vagrant directory. (Not to be confused with /home/vagrant.) 

This is important. Your /vagrant directory is linked to the host machine on the outside. In fact, if you examine it, you will realize it is your ~/Lab-03 directory!

````
vagrant@precise64:~$ cd /vagrant
vagrant@precise64:/vagrant$ ls
Lab-03-Instructions.md  LICENSE  README.md  resources  starter.sh  Vagrantfile
````

Starting with starter.sh, write a shell script that 

1. automates the directory creation and 
2. tree installation and use.  

Review your Unix commands as necessary. The command to install tree is 

apt-get install tree

  * Use Nano. Notice the shebang (#!/bin/bash) at the top of starter.sh. 

  * Name it YourID-Lab03.sh

  * You will need to change (chmod) the permissions correctly to run it. 
  
So:

    vagrant@precise64:/vagrant$ cp starter.sh YourID-Lab03.sh
        
Remember to substitute your actual ID for "YourID." 

Create your script. Use "tree" to see your results and "rm -rf A C D" to delete the directories if you need to run the script several times to perfect it 

````

vagrant@precise64:~/Lab-03$ chmod 755 teststud-Lab03.sh 
````

Run it & confirm it works. 

    vagrant@precise64:~/Lab-03$./YourID-Lab03.sh  <- notice the "./"
    
Oops, something seems to be wrong:

````
vagrant@precise64:~/Lab-03$ ./teststud-Lab03.sh 
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?
 
````

Because the script has installations in it, you need to run it as superuser:

````    
vagrant@precise64:~/Lab-03$ sudo ./teststud-Lab03.sh 
Reading package lists...
Building dependency tree...

git is already the newest version.

````

What did it do?

First, it did NOT install tree, since that is already there. That's ok. 
Second, it DID create your directories and files:

````
vagrant@precise64:~/vagrant$ tree
.

In reviewing the directory structure, there are duplicate directories. Fix the directory creation logic so that there are not duplicate C and D directories (you will need to use another letter). 

Run it & confirm it works

Review differences and check in. 

*You are now doing "infrastructure as code."* 

When you are satisfied, push it back into your github remote account and issue a pull request so that I review it. Commit it to your github fork (on your remote account). NOTE: IF YOU DO NOT DO PUSH IT BACK TO GITHUB YOU WILL LOSE YOUR SCRIPT WHEN YOU DESTROY YOUR VM!

````

Vagrant destroy your vm:

    vagrant@precise64:~/Lab-03$cd ..
    vagrant@precise64:~$ vagrant destroy

**Automate provisioning with Vagrant**

Edit your Vagrantfile so that it calls your *-Lab03.sh script when you provision the machine. Add the "vm.provision" line, changing MyID to your ID. 

````
Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
  config.vm.box = "precise64"
  config.ssh.private_key_path =   "~/.ssh/insecure_private_key"
  config.vm.provision              :shell, path: "./MyID-Lab03.sh"
end
````

Vagrant up your machine and ssh into it, verify that your script has been run. Including installing tree. 

**Using Chef instead of shell**

Advance notice: Next week, we will Write a Chef recipe that is run by Vagrant to do the same thing. You cannot just call your previous script.

Run, check in to Github when succeeds, and alter it so it also installs curl

Check in and observe differences.
